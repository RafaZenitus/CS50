Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery.
Interviews were conducted today withthree witnesses who were present at the time â€“

Interview: SELECT transcript FROM interviews WHERE day = 28 and month = 7;

As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
